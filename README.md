# Pokedex APP

You can see a preview of the website at [this link](https://pokedex-3b2fc.web.app/). This is a simple pokedex created using [https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2](PokeAPI V2) to read and display Pok√®Mon data.

## About the website

The website is made using Angular v13 - now refactored to v15 to implement standalone components. It is a very simple yet (hopefully) effective showcase of my abilities in API integration, SCSS, TypeScript, HTML5, UI and UX design and attention to responsiveness (check out mobile sizes too!).

The actual list of Pokemon is parsed from the Pokedex.ts file available in the shared folder, while the specific informations related to a pokemon are parsed from the PokeAPI V2 APIs. You can Search and Filter Pokemons and see their combact stats, evolution lines and extra informations.
