# Pokedex APP

You can see a preview of the website at [this link](https://pokedex-3b2fc.web.app/). This is a simple pokedex created using [https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2](PokeAPI V2) to read and display Pok√®Mon data.

## About the website

The website is made using Angular v13 - now refactored to v15 to implement standalone components. It is a very simple yet (hopefully) effective showcases of my abilities in API integration, SCSS, TypeScript, HTML5, UI and UX design and attention to responsiveness (it's mobile-friendly).

You can Search and Filter Pokemons and see their combact stats, evolution lines and extra informations fetched using the PokeAPI V2 APIs.
